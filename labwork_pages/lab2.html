    <h2>Task 1: Digitisation</h2>
    <p>
      I have decided to transcribe a string ensemble cover of "The Ballad of the Witches' Road". <br>
      This cover was arranged by J.O.R.J and can be found on MuseScore - <a href="https://musescore.com/user/28095304/scores/20258779">The Ballad of the Witches' Road arranged by J.O.R.J</a>
      <br><br>
      Originally, this arrangement was created for string instruments along with Timpani and Chimes but for the purposes of this task I have decided to focus on transcription of the string 
      instruments only. 
      <br><br>
      When I initially transcribed the piece in the OMR engine, not much of the piece was correct. It changed all of the instruments to voice and didn't give the piece a time signature. 
      This resulted in a lot of the notes being the wrong length, for example, a lot of crotchets were changed to quavers. The conversion also added in quite a lot of rests where there should 
      have been notes.
