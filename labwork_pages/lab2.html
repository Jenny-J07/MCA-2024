    <h2>Task 1: Digitisation</h2>
    <p>
      I have decided to transcribe a string ensemble cover of "The Ballad of the Witches' Road". <br>
      This cover was arranged by J.O.R.J and can be found on MuseScore - <a href="https://musescore.com/user/28095304/scores/20258779">The Ballad of the Witches' Road arranged by J.O.R.J</a>
      <br><br>
      Originally, this arrangement was created for string instruments along with Timpani and Chimes but for the purposes of this task I have decided to focus on transcription of the string 
      instruments only. 
      <br><br>
      When I initially transcribed the piece in the OMR engine, not much of the piece was correct. It changed all of the instruments to voice and didn't give the piece a time signature. 
      This resulted in a lot of the notes being the wrong length, for example, a lot of crotchets were changed to quavers. The conversion also added in quite a lot of rests where there should 
      have been notes. We found the same issues in our group discussion on Tuesday. The piece that we tried to transcribe with the OMR engine in the group replaced a lot of notes with rests.
      <br><br>
      After looking through the transcribed piece, I decided that I would be more effective for me to transcribe the piece myself, rather than trying to correct the OMR engine transcription.
