    <h2>Task 1: Similarity</h2>
    <p> 

      Using jupyter notebook, I have created a similarity graph based off of a range of provided tracks and the three tracks that relate to my theme. <br>
      My tracks are 7, 8 and 9. Tracks 8 and 9 were created by the same person, we can see in this similarity graph that both of those tracks are quite similar. <br>
      Track 7 is quite different from both 8 and 9. From this graph we can see that 7 is more similar to track 8 than 9.

      <div>
        <h4>Analysis:</h4>
        When comparing the transcriptions, we can see that the time signature has been changed on the polyphonic transcription from 4/4 to 3/4.
        It has also lost all of the information about what instruments are playing, the polyphonic transcription is for piano but the original 
        score contains a multitude of string instruments. Because the transcription has attempted to combine all of the 
        instruments into one score, there are a large amount of ledger lines above and below the stave, making the polyphonic transcription very 
        messy. The tempo has also been changed, although only slightly from 100 to 102.<br>
        <br>
        When listening to the original vs the polyphonic transcription, they are quite different. It has made a lot of the notes longer, 
        while keeping a similar pitch to the original piece. Bars 1-6 are most like the original piece, the song becomes quite distorted after 
        bar 6 and harder to identify as the same song.
