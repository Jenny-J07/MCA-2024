    <h2>Task 1: Theme</h2>
    <p>
      The overarching theme I have chosen for my dataset is the music from the Dinsey+ show - 'Agatha all Along'.
      <br><br>
      The song I will be focusing on is - "The Ballad of the Witches' Road (Sacred Chant Version)", performed by: Kathryn Hahn, Sasheer Zamata, Ali Ahn, Patti Lupone and 
      Debra Jo Rupp. Written by: Kristen Anderson-Lopez, Robert Lopez, Andrew Asemokai, Christophe Beck and Michael Paraskevas.

    <h2>Task 2: Potential Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Access, Curation and Distribution:</b><br>
      From my own experience music is quite difficult to access in different file formats. Because most people use streaming services 
      it has become very difficult to purchase a .mp3 version of a song and you cannot download it from any streaming services. 
      <br><br>
      If you look at curation from the perspective of streaming services, it is very easy for users to create their own personalised 
      collections with whatever songs they would like. Streaming services in general are very good collections of music but some issues arise 
      if certain artists remove themselves from specific platforms. 
      <br><br>

      <b>Challenges I have experienced with my selected theme:</b><br>
      Trying to find sheet music was quite difficult as the piece of music I was looking for was quite new. There were some fan-made versions 
      of the score on MuseScore, but to download any of the scores you either need to purchase them or purchase a subscription to 
      MuseScore. 

      <br>

      I have also found it difficult to retrieve a .mp3 file of my chosen song. Itunes has changed and no longer lets you purchase the .mp3 versions 
      of certain songs due to copyright restrictions. 
      
      <br><br>
      My chosen song is currently avaliable on all music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple music etc. As previously mentioned, I was unable 
      to find an offical score for the song. On streaming platforms (I will use Spotify as an example), it gives credits for the performers, writers and producers. 
      There is also information about the duration of the song and an integrated feature on Spotify that shows the lyrics while the song is playing.
